________________
The project activity is titled- “KCIL 4.2 MW Waste Heat to Power Project in Gujarat, India”.
The project activity is developed by M/s. Kutch Chemical Industries Ltd., involves the recovery
of waste heat from the sulphuric acid production process for electricity generation. This initiative
displaces a portion of grid electricity, which is predominantly sourced from fossil fuel-based
power plants.

The project activity is a water heat recovery project. A Heat Recovery System (HRS) has been
installed to capture waste heat, which is utilized to generate steam. The steam is then supplied
to a turbine for power generation. The system has a generation capacity of 4.2 MW, and was
installed & operated in Padana Village of Gandhidham Taluk, Kutch district in the Indian state of
Gujarat.

The project generates approximately 25,106.29 MWh of clean electricity in the current
monitoring period. The generated electricity is used for captive purpose within the plant itself.
This project activity addresses the energy demand-supply in unit by supporting the region’s
sustainable growth.

The start date of the project activity is the commissioning date of WHRS, which is 30/12/2006.
The project has been operational since the commissioning date.
This project activity was not registered in any other registries prior to its registration in UCR. PP
seeks verification under UCR from 01/01/2013 onwards, i.e., crediting period for UCR starts
from 01/01/2013. Hence, there is no double counting for said projects.

The project consists of 1 waste heat recovery system (WHRS) of 4.2. The technical
specifications of the waste heat recovery system is mentioned in monitoring report.

Commissioning date of the project activity is mentioned in the table below:
